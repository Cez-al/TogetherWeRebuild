Together We Rebuild: A Decentralized Crowdfunding Solution
In September 2024, a catastrophic flood swept through Poland, causing immense destruction in cities and small towns. This disaster highlighted the urgent need for innovative solutions to provide aid effectively, which led me to explore how blockchain technology could be used in humanitarian efforts.

Together We Rebuild is a decentralized crowdfunding platform, designed to bring transparency and trust back to charitable giving. Many existing donation platforms fail to offer transparency, leaving donors unsure of where their contributions go. Together We Rebuild eliminates this issue by utilizing blockchain for real-time tracking of donations.

The application is built on the Sepolia testnet, where anyone can view the current contract balance (https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xdcecfcf99f1ae176d4c929e6a55380240340d2e1), the fundraising target, and the end date—all without needing to connect a wallet.

Once connected, users can choose to donate anonymously or with a nickname. After a donation is made, the transaction hash is displayed, allowing the donor to verify their contribution on the blockchain. The contract’s balance updates in real-time, ensuring complete transparency.

In its current version, the withdrawal function is restricted to the contract owner, but future plans include enabling verified individuals in need, in collaboration with local authorities, to directly access funds. This would allow for a more streamlined and impactful distribution of aid, cutting out intermediaries and bringing assistance where it is needed most.

This is just the beginning. Together We Rebuild has the potential to revolutionize how we approach humanitarian crises. Thank you for your interest in this project.
